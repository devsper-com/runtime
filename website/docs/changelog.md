## [Unreleased]

---

## [2.1.5] — 2026-03-11

### Added

- **In-app HITL resolution** — Optional in-process resolver so you can approve/reject HITL requests in the same terminal as `devsper run`.
- **HITL in single-node path** — HITL escalation check and resolver/polling now run in the default single-node flow.
- **Better MCP** — `devsper doctor` has a dedicated "MCP Servers" section.
- Full CLI visual redesign: amber/blue/teal color system across all commands
- Structured logging with tracing-compatible format
- Live run view: real-time task table, tool activity, cost counter during execution
- Animated planning phase with strategy selection feedback
- Redesigned devsper init: interactive wizard with welcome screen
- Typed error classes with actionable hints and docs links
- Shell completions: bash, zsh, fish
- `--debug`, `--trace`, `--quiet`, `--no-color`, `--json`, `--plain` global flags

### Changed

- All CLI output uses themed console
- Python logging replaced with devsperLogger
- Error display: no raw tracebacks shown to end users
- **Planner: simple-task fast path** — Short, single-step prompts no longer get decomposed into 5 steps
- **Planner: dynamic step count** — Planner asks for "the minimal number of smaller steps needed"

---
